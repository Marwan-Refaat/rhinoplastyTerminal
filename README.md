# Rhinoplasty Measurements

This Python script was initially created as a personal project to faciltate the calculation of multiple measurements used in lower-third facial analysis, usually used in the field of [Rhinoplasty](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/rhinoplasty/about/pac-20384532). In addition to allowing for accurate length measurements of various facial features, this script specifically supports the following facial analysis methods:
1. Legan's Method
2. Silver's Method
3. Goode's Method
